      Well what can I say? It's a sports car. And its from Bugatti. I don't know
      much about cars but I guess I will have to do some research.

      Their website says it's one of their most powerful ever. I believe them
      because my friend showed me a youtube video that shows it going from 0 to
      400 and back to 0 kilometers per hour in just 42 seconds. So yeah, that's
      pretty freaking dope!
